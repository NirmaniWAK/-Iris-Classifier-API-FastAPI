ðŸŒ¸ Iris Classifier API (FastAPI)

## Problem

The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning.

Contains 150 samples of iris flowers.

Each sample has 4 features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

Task: Classify a flower into one of 3 species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

## Model

Algorithm: Logistic Regression (with StandardScaler for feature scaling)

Dataset: Iris dataset (from scikit-learn)

Accuracy: ~0.95 on the test set

## Tech Stack
